sa0=sdOldMajor
m1=Now,WAIT comrades,WAIT what is the nature of this life of ours?WAITWAIT Let us face it, our lives are miserable, laborious and short.WAITWAIT No animal in England is free.WAITWAIT The life of an animal is misery and slavery:WAIT that is the plain truth.
p1=Old Major
sa1=sdOldMajor
m2=But is this simply part of the order of Nature?WAITWAIT Is it because this land of ours is so poor that it cannot afford a decent life to those who dewll upon it?
p2=Old Major
sa2=sdOldMajor
m3=No,WAIT comrades,WAIT a thousand times no!
p3=Old Major
sa3=sdOldMajor
m4=Man is the only creature that consumes without producing.WAITWAIT He does not give milk,WAIT he does not lay eggs,WAIT he is too weak to pull the plough,WAIT he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits.WAITWAIT Yet he is lord of all the animals.
p4=Old Major
sa4=sdOldMajor
m5=Our labour tills the soil,WAIT our dung fertilises it,WAIT and yet there is not one of us that owns more than his bare skin.
p5=Old Major
sa5=sdOldMajor
m6=Clover,WAIT where are those four foals you bore,WAIT who should have been the support and pleasure of your old age?WAITWAIT Each was sold at a year old WAITWAIT-WAITWAIT you will never see one of them again.

p8=Old Major
sa8=sdOldMajor
sb8=sdBoxer
m9=Is it not crystal clear,WAIT then,WAIT comrades,WAIT that all the evils of this life of ours spring from the tyranny of human beings?WAITWAIT Only get rid of Man,WAIT and the produce of our labour would be our own.WAITWAIT Almost overnight we could become rich and free.
p9=Old Major

m10=This is my message to you,WAIT comrades:WAITWAITWAITWAIT Rebellion!
p10=Old Major

m11=Remember your duty of enmity towards Man and all his ways.WAITWAIT Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.WAITWAIT Whatever goes upon four legs,WAIT or has wings,WAIT is a friend.WAITWAIT And remember that in fighting against Man,WAIT we must not come to resemble him.WAITWAIT Even when you have conquered him,WAIT do not adopt his vices.
p11=Old Major
sa11=sdOldMajor
m12=No animal must ever live in a house,WAIT or sleep in a bed,WAIT or wear clothes,WAIT or drink alcohol,WAIT or smoke tobacco,WAIT or touch money,WAIT or engage in trade.WAITWAIT#And above all, no animal must ever tyrannise over his own kind.

p11=Squealer
sa11=sdSnowball
sb11=sdSquealer
m12=Many of us actually dislike milk and apples.WAITWAIT I dislike them myself.WAITWAIT Our sole objective in taking these things is to preserve our health. Milk and apples WAIT(this has been proved by Science,WAIT comrades)WAIT contain substances absolutely necessary to the well-being of aCOLa pigCOLd.
p12=Squealer
sa12=sdSnowball

[Windmill]
m0=Hello,WAIT comrades.WAITWAIT Today we are here to discuss plans for improving Animal Farm.WAITWAIT As you know,WAIT I have come up with some plans for creating aCOLl WindmillCOLd.
p0=Snowball
sa0=sdSnowball
m1=ThisCOLl WindmillCOLd will certainly take a lot of work.WAITWAIT Stone from theCOLl QuarryCOLd would have to be carryied up to theCOLl HillCOLd and then built up into walls.
p1=Snowball
sa1=sdSnowball
m2=Sails would then have to be made,WAIT, and there will be need for dynamos and cables.
p2=Snowball
sa2=sdSnowball
m3=I assure you,WAIT comrades,WAIT this whole process can be done in a year.WAITWAIT After the year of hard work,WAIT so much labour will be saved that we'll only need to work for three days a week!
p3=Snowball
sa3=sdSnowball
m4=No!WAITWAIT At this time it is more important to increase food production.WAITWAIT If we waste time on theCOLl WindmillCOLd we will all starve to death!

p6=Benjamin
sa6=sdSnowball
sb6=sdNapoleon
m7=Another issue we must discuss is the defence of the farm.
p7=Napoleon
sa7=sdSnowball
sb7=sdNapoleon
m8=What we must do is procure firearms and train ourselves in the use of them.
p8=Napoleon
sa8=sdSnowball
sb8=sdNapoleon
m9=No,WAIT comrades,WAIT what we must do is send out more and moreCOLa PigeonsCOLd and stir up rebellion among the animals on the other farms.
p9=Snowball
sa9=sdSnowball
sb9=sdNapoleon
m10=If we cannot defend ourselves we are bound to be conquered.
p10=Napoleon
sa10=sdSnowball

m11=If rebellions happened everywhere we would have no need to defend ourselves.
p11=Snowball
sa11=sdSnowball

p25=Squealer (Later)

m26=On the contrary,WAIT it is a deep and heavy responsibility.WAITWAIT No one believes more firmly thanCOLa Comrade NapoleonCOLd that all animals are equal.
p26=Squealer

m27=He would be only too happy to let you make your decisions for yourselves.WAITWAIT But sometimes you might make the wrong decisions,WAIT comrades,WAIT and then where would we be?WAITWAIT Suppose you had decided to followCOLa SnowballCOLd,WAIT with his moonshine ofCOLl WindmillsCOLd.

p4=Squealer
sa4=sdSquealer
sb4=sdClover
m5=Why,WAIT then,WAIT had he spoken so strongly against it?
p5=Clover
sa5=sdSquealer
sb5=sdClover
m6=That wasCOLa Comrade Napoleon'sCOLd cunning.WAITWAIT He hadSIZEi seemedSIZEd to oppose theCOLl WindmillCOLd,WAIT simply as a manoeuvre to get rid ofCOLa SnowballCOLd,WAIT who was a dangerous character and a bad influence.WAITWAIT Now thatCOLa SnowballCOLd is out of the way the plan could go forward without his interference.

p10=Squealer

m11=From now onwards Animal Farm will engage in trade with the neighbouring farms.WAITWAIT Not,WAIT of course,WAIT for any commercial purpose but simply in order to obtain certain materials which are urgently necessary.
p11=Napoleon
sa11=sdNapoleon
m12=The needs of theCOLl WindmillCOLd must override everything else.WAITWAIT I am therefore making arrangements to sell a stack of hay and part of the current year's wheat crop,WAIT and later on,WAIT if more money were needed,WAIT it will have to be made up by the sale of eggs.
